# Rust Learning Journey

This repository is a reflection of my journey learning Rust.

My goal is to document this process from the very first step to wherever it eventually leads.  
I want this repository to show my progress openly, including mistakes, confusion, and gradual improvement over time.

I chose Rust because of its **strict and disciplined nature**.  
The language does not allow you to ignore mistakes easily, and that is exactly what attracted me.  
Its focus on safety and correctness forces you to think carefully, and I want to build my foundation on that mindset.

My long-term goal is to make Rust my main programming language and use it to work on large and complex projects in the future.

## How I learn

I prefer **learning by doing**.

Copy-pasting code or rewriting the exact same solution while looking at it does not work for me.  
Instead, I try to write everything myself, even if it means making mistakes or getting stuck.

I believe that struggling, breaking things, and understanding *why* something is wrong is the best way for me to truly learn.  
Even when my code is imperfect, I move forward by slowly understanding what I did wrong and how to improve it.

This repository reflects that process.

## Repository structure

Projects are grouped into learning levels.

**Level 1 – Fundamentals & Logic Building:** Covers basics, control flow, loops, vectors, and ownership basics.

Each level contains multiple small projects and experiments focused on specific concepts.  
As the difficulty increases, some projects (like the Labyrinth game) include their own README files with additional explanations.

The structure is expected to evolve over time as my understanding of Rust grows.

## Notes

This repository is primarily for learning purposes.  
Older code may be refactored, reorganized, or rewritten as I progress.

The focus here is not perfection, but **consistency and honest progress**.
